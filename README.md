MicroMouse

This is code for a Micromouse controlled using an Atmel Atmega328p. It was writen using Atmel Studio. 

The mouse used the following hardware: 
  X4 Infrared phototransistor and IR LED pairs for wall detection
  , an ST LY3200 gyro for direction tracking
  , Pololu micro metal geared motors with X1 magnetic encoder for distance tracking
  , and uses a plug-in Bluetooth module for communications.

There is no "main function". 
The folder "functions" is all the subordinate fuctions used by the higher level functions. 
All the other functions are test functions
